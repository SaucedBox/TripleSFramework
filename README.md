# SSS (Triple S Framework)

SSS (Sauce's Standard Sturcture) is a framework that aims to provide the basic parts of a video game, such as lighting, collision, UI, and more. It was created by me and was intended for just my use, but if can somehow manage to use it for your own game then god bless you. It uses Lua as it's scripting language for maps and stuff, and HLSL for shading (shocker). It took about a month to create but that's a month saved on other games. 

## How do I SSS????

Read the wiki lol
